# Port-Scheduler-C-
Developed a real-time scheduler for 12,000+ ships using shared memory and 5+ message queues for efficient inter-process coordination, applying IPC and synchronization primitives.
Optimized dock-crane assignment across 30 docks, enhancing scheduling efficiency under strict OS-level synchronization.
Streamlined 8-threaded brute-force logic to decode 100-character secure undocking strings within execution time limits, demonstrating expertise in POSIX threads and concurrency control.
